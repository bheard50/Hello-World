# Hello-World
My attempt to advance my scripting knowledge

I have been working in Information Technology for a very long time now.  I have done many jobs and have had many titles through out my career.  I have been working with powershell v3.0 for past 6 months.  I am tying to become self sufficient with powershell so I can maintain my 600 servers and 4000 workstations.  I use Microsoft Systems Configuraiton Manager for security patches and software distribution.  I am hoping to automate many of the reports I run and create scripts that other engineers can use to increase their productivity.
